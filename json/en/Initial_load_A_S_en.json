They have already instilled their children, and like most parents, They withdrew their responsibility for this decision, and delegated it to others. Subconsciously they understand that if it turns out that vaccinations are not completely harmless, then they endangered health, and perhaps even the lives of their children. It is difficult to realize this. It is much easier to live thinking that a child has already been born that way. With allergies, delayed development, with persistent otitis, with any autoimmune disease, or even with a bunch of diseases. It is very difficult to live with the knowledge that you gave him this disease. Delegating authority, and disclaiming responsibility for this decision. Zealously defending vaccinations, even knowing nothing about them, these parents protect themselves from powerful cognitive dissonance. <br> <br> Therefore, if you have already fully implanted your children, you are not going to make new vaccinations, and your grandchildren are still far away, probably you should not be interested in this topic. Although, on the other hand, many of the consequences of vaccinations are cured if one realizes that they are acquired, rather than congenital. "

In total there are approximately 15 vaccinations: hepatitis B, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, poliomyelitis, hemophilic rod B, measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, hepatitis A, rotavirus, pneumococcus, papilloma and influenza. In some countries, vaccinations against tuberculosis and meningococcus are also done. It is necessary to make a separate decision on each vaccination. All these diseases are different, there are more dangerous and less dangerous. All vaccinations are also different. There is also a big difference between vaccinations of different manufacturers, their effectiveness and side effects. There is a difference between vaccinations from the same disease in different countries.

Since no one has conducted adequate vaccination studies, it is difficult to estimate the real number of side effects, the most optimistic estimates, serious consequences occur more often than in one in fifty (see part 5). Half (!) Children in the US [has == https: //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21570014] at least one chronic disease, and their number is constantly increasing [https: //www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160430100357.htm]. Of course, not all diseases are associated with vaccinations, but who knows how much they are connected, if no one is researching it? <br> Personally, I suppose that the consequences of vaccinations are almost everyone.) Simply most of them are implicit, but even if they are explicit , few people associate them with vaccination, for example, it is known that brain damage is one of the rare but possible consequences of vaccination, but how many children have brain damage that is not very significant, and as a result, they will lose only 10 IQ points, or they will get small problems with memory, with the end centration, or with social interaction? Could it be that the decline [of the Flynn effect == https: //ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%AD%D1%84%D1%84%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82_%D0% A4% D0% BB% D0% B8% D0% BD% D0% BD% D0% B0] is the result of a sharp increase in the number of vaccinations in the last couple of decades? Nobody checked this. But this is a completely logical assumption. If you take a newborn child who has not yet fully formed a blood-brain barrier, and inject him with a vaccine containing mercury or aluminum, which are neurotoxins, and some of which are sure to get into the brain, is it not logical to expect that this or that effect will be every child? And if we repeat this procedure several dozen times during the first years of life, is it not logical to assume that this will further strengthen the effect? â€‹â€‹"
