It seems that the skin infection of streptococcus and staphylococcus predisposes to secondary infection with diphtheria and a low level of hygiene is the main contributing factor. In the 1970s there was an epidemic of diphtheria in Seattle. Out of 558 cases, 334 were from Skid Road (ie homeless). 3 people died. 74% had skin diphtheria. 70% were heavy alcoholics. <br> - In 1971 there was a diphtheria outbreak in Vancouver (44 cases). The majority of the sick were begging alcoholics. <br> - In 1973, an outbreak among the children of the Indians.

Among the 16-year-olds, In addition to infant vaccinations, a booster was also obtained, and the antibody level was below 0.01 in 24%. <br> <br> It is possible that the low level of antibodies in Sweden is due to the fact that the pertussis component was excluded from the vaccine in the 1970s.As pertussis toxin is in itself an adjuvant , its exclusion makes the diphtheria vaccine less effective. <br> <br> The immune response to the booster among the 16-year-olds was much worse than that of the 6-year-old, even though the 16-year-old received a 2.5-fold dose.
