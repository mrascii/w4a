From this point of view, it seems that the lack of vaccines for all 315 million citizen The United States borders on the unethical, yet people across the country are being vaccinated against influenza, especially in medical institutions, precisely because not everyone wants it, and coercion is the only way to achieve high vaccination coverage. In the 1960s CDC recommended the vaccine only for the elderly (65 and older), in 1984, medical personnel were also inoculated, and in 1987, those who lived in the same house with the elderly were added. In 1997, they began to vaccinate pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimester. In 2000, they began to vaccinate those who are over 50. In 2004, they began to vaccinate pregnant women in the first trimester, children from 6 months to two years, as well as all those who contact them. In 2006, the recommendation extended to children under 5 years old, and all who contact them. In 2008, they began to vaccinate all children under the age of 18, and in 2010, the rest of the population, except for infants under 6 months. The CDC, on the basis of one observational study that it funded, claims that the influenza vaccine reduces mortality from all causes among the elderly by 48%. If this is true, then a flu vaccine can save more lives than any other medicine registered on the planet. If influenza is only responsible for 5% of winter mortality, then the vaccine against it can not prevent half of all deaths. If observational studies are impossible to believe, what evidence is there for reducing mortality among the elderly due to vaccination? Practically none. There was only one randomized study among the elderly, it was 20 years ago, and it did not show a decrease in mortality. That is, a flu vaccine is recommended despite a complete lack of clinical trials proving its effectiveness. The recommendation is based only on the development of antibodies, but there is no evidence that these antibodies lead to a reduction in morbidity. And since at the moment the vaccine is recommended to everyone, it is already unethical to conduct a randomized trial. "

I have seen how patients in nursing homes and staff begin because of them vomiting, diarrhea, hallucinations, delirium, and worsening cognitive function. The IOM recommends taking 600 IU vitamin D for those under 70 years old to reach the level of 50 nmol/L in 97.5% of people. However, their recommendation contains a statistical error, and in fact, you need to take 8800 IU to achieve this For several years, as I and my colleague have given vitamin D to patients, and most of them have a vitamin level of more than 100 nmol/L. We rarely see patients with influenza or ARD, and when we see, we give them shock doses of vitamin D (a one-time dose of 50,000 IU, or 10,000 IU three times a day for 2-3 days) Symptoms completely pass for 48-72 hours Vitamin D costs a penny for 1000 IU, that is, this treatment costs less dollar.
