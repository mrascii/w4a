In adults, complications from mumps are more common, and these complications are more serious than in children, especially among the unvaccinated. In other countries, outbreaks of mumps among vaccinated people are also observed, the reason for this is the diminishing effectiveness of the vaccine, and in the absence of natural boosters. It is also possible that outbreaks are primarily to blame for the overestimated effectiveness, inadequate vaccination coverage, or the presence of a strain that is not covered by the vaccine.<br> The presence of outbreaks among vaccinated and falling effectiveness make one think about a third dose of the vaccine. Such an experiment was conducted in the USA during outbreaks in 2009 and 2010. Both times the outbreak receded a few weeks after vaccination. However, outbreaks always go to waste, and it is unclear whether this was due to the vaccine. Nevertheless, this and other experiments hint that the third dose of a vaccine is a good idea. In addition, during the vaccination campaigns in the United States, the third dose showed few side effects.<br> The Netherlands wanted to introduce a third dose of MMR into the national vaccination schedule, but changed their mind, because, firstly, the mumps rarely get complications, and secondly, it is unlikely that vaccination coverage among adults will be satisfactory.<br> Outbreaks of mumps among vaccinated, as well as this study, led to the fact that the Ministry of Health of France recommended doing a third dose of MMR during outbreaks. Despite the fact that it is not known whether the vaccine is effective for those already infected with the virus, it is possible that vaccination will shorten the period of infectiousness of the vaccinated.<br> In a Dutch study, it was found that two-thirds are ill during the outbreaks asymptomatically. The role of asymptomatic patients in the transmission of the disease remains unknown.<br> Future observations in France, and possibly also in other countries that adopt such a recommendation, will help determine whether a third dose of MMR is effective during outbreaks."

Cells in which viruses are grown must multiply, and for this they need a nutrient medium with hormones, growth factors, proteins, amino acids, vitamins and t As embryonic bovine serum is usually used as this medium.<br> Because the whey should be preferably sterile, it is not blood of cows but blood of calf embryos that is used for its production. <br> The pregnant cow is killed and the uterus is taken out of it, then the fetus is removed from the uterus, the umbilical cord is cut and disinfected, and then the heart is pierced and the blood is pumped out.Sometimes a pump is used for this, and sometimes a massage, and then the blood is coagulated and centrifuged from it platelets and clotting factors are separated, what remains as a result is fetal bovine serum. In addition to the right ingredients, the serum can also contain viruses, bacteria, yeasts, fungi, mycoplasmas, endotoxins and possibly [prions==https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%8B]. Many components of bovine serum have not yet been determined, and the function of many of those that are determined is unknown.<br> Three months of the embryo produces 150 ml of serum, of a six-month period 350 ml, and of a nine-month period 550 ml. (Pregnancy of cows lasts 9 months). The world market of bovine serum is 500,000 liters per year, which requires about 2 million pregnant cows. (At the moment, the whey market [is==https://www.invitria.com/cell-culture-products-types/serum/] is already 700,000 liters.)<br><br> Next, the authors examine the literature on the topic, Does the fetus suffer during piercing the heart and pumping out the blood.<br> Because the fetus that is separated from the placenta is experiencing [anoxia==https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%90%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%8F] (acute lack of oxygen), perhaps this leads to the fact that the pain signals do not reach the brain, and the fetus does not suffer. , it turns out that unlike adult rabbits, which die after 1.5 minutes ano Xenia, prematurely born rabbits live without oxygen for 44 minutes. This is because the embryos and newborns compensate for the lack of oxygen through anaerobic metabolism. In addition, the fetal brain consumes much less oxygen than the adult brain. Among other species of animals, a similar pattern is observed, but no one has checked the calves.<br> Science has only recently wondered whether a mammalian fetus or newborn pain is affected. Just ten years ago, it was believed that infants are less sensitive to pain than adults, so the operation of preterm and born infants was done without anesthesia. Today it is believed that the human fetus is experiencing pain from the 24th week, and can suffer from the 11th week after conception. Moreover, embryos and newborns are more sensitive to pain than adults, since they have not yet developed [https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9D%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B5%D0%BF%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F] Mechanism of suppression of physiological pain. Therefore, the fetus may feel pain even if it is simply touched. The authors conclude that during piercing the heart the fetus has normal brain activity, it experiences pain and suffers when the blood is pumped out of it, and possibly even after the end of this procedure , before dying.<br> Next, the authors speculate whether it is possible to anesthetize the fetus so that it does not feel pain. Some believe that anoxia itself plays the role of an anesthetic, but it is not. In addition, newborn mammals are very poor at absorbing medicines. And the presence of these drugs in the serum is undesirable. Electroshock also does not fit, as it leads to cardiac arrest. The authors believe that perhaps a bolt that is correctly stuffed into the brain will lead to brain death of the fetus. Some manufacturers claim that they kill the fetus before the blood is extracted from it. But this is not true, because blood coagulates immediately after death, and to extract it, the fetus must be alive. The authors conclude that the procedure for collecting embryonic bovine serum is inhumane. "
