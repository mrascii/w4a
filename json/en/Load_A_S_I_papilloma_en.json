Moreover, the risk of death from cancer the cervix continues to fall rapidly, in the 90s, without any vaccinations, it fell 2 times.)<br><br> An even greater reduction in deaths from cervical cancer due to vaccination in the developed is very unlikely.<br><i>Efficacy:</i><br><br> Since the development of cancer of the uterus gang takes decades, and the pharmaceutical company does not want to wait that long, surrogate markers, that is, dysplasias CIN 1-3, develop faster in clinical trials of vaccines, but because the vast majority of these dysplasias go by themselves, they are rather bad marker for cancer of the uterus.<br><br> about yourself, the test for dysplasia, especially CIN 2, is very inaccurate, which also makes it a bad marker.<br><br> Therefore, the effectiveness of a vaccine, determined based on dysplasia, is not evidence of the effectiveness of a vaccination against cervical cancer.<br> - Analyzing clinical studies, the effectiveness of Gardasil in the prevention of CIN 2-3 associated with any strain of HPV was only 14-17%. (This is the real effectiveness of the vaccine, but even it is too high, because not all of these dysplasias will go to cancer.) - The effectiveness of the vaccine for those already infected with HPV was negative (from -33% to - 44%). That is, in those who are already infected, inoculation increases the chance of dysplasia. These results were not mentioned in the article published by Merck. Nevertheless, the FDA does not require checking before vaccination, was there already an infection.<br> - Prevention of CIN 1-3 from strains 16/18 was 100%. But the statistical significance of these results is rather doubtful.<br> First, the confidence interval is very wide. The vaccination prevented 3 CIN 1-3 cases in one group, and 7 cases in another. Second, CIN 1 only passes into cancer in 1% of cases. But since the number of CIN 1 cases is much higher compared to CIN 2-3, the summation of CIN 1 with CIN 2-3 completely distorts statistics.<br> - The authors further analyze the clinical studies of the Cervarix vaccine, with similar conclusions.<br> - After 7 -and years the effectiveness of Cervarix in the prevention of CIN 2 was only 40.6%, with a confidence interval of -106.0 to 84.7.<br> <i> Safety: </ i><br> - Between 2006 and 2012, more than 20,000 cases of side effects from this vaccination, of which 8% are serious. 73 people died, 581 became disabled. Since the system of registration of vaccine side effects (VAERS) is passive, according to various estimates, it registers only 1% to 10% of all cases. Therefore, the real number of side effects is 10-100 times greater.<br><br> Of all the side effects of vaccinations in girls in the age group of 6-29 years, 65% of all serious side effects are due to HPV vaccinations.<br> - 82% of disabilities in girls younger than 30 years associated with vaccination against HPV.<br><br> In Australia, the number of serious side effects increased by 85% due to vaccination against HPV. The same thing happens in other countries.<br><br> In the Cervarix test, which included 9000 women, 8% had a serious side effect, 32% had a significant side effect, 9% had spontaneous abortion, 3% had a new chronic disease. Similar side effects were observed in the control group, but we remember that the control group received the same vaccine, but without the antigen.<br><br> In the UK, side effects from Cervarix were observed 8 times more often than from the MMR vaccine.

The third study is much better, but it is: a) it is not a randomized trial but a retrospective study. <br > b) is based only on hospital data, that is, if the illness does not require hospitalization, it is not taken into account. Not all diseases require hospitalization. Menopause at age 13, for example, does not require.<br> c) lasted only 6 months, whereas the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases can take several years. D) includes in the same way those who received a single dose of a vaccine, two doses or three doses (on average, all received 2.3 doses).<br> e) has so broad confidence intervals that such statistics are difficult to be considered seriously as a safety argument. Even this study established that vaccination increases the chance of developing a diabetes of the first type, Behcet's disease (systemic vasculitis) and disease New Reynaud (type of ischemia). Take for example Behcet's disease, the risk of which increases from vaccination by 3.4 times and is 2 per 100,000. If we remember that mortality from cervical cancer is 1.4 per 100,000, then the risk of cancer exchange in 40 years, at the same risk of an incurable autoimmune disease now, does not look like a very good deal. This, you might say, is the worst health deal in the history of health deals. And this is not even starting to talk about other autoimmune incurable diseases, the risk of which this vaccine increases (diabetes by 1.98 and Reynaud at 6.91/100,000). Moreover, the vaccine, according to this study, reduces (!) The risk of epilepsy and paralysis. Given the numerous cases of paralysis after HPV vaccination (for example, [one==https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHYmb9Hwj4A], for example), as well as conflicts of interest of authors who received funding from Merck and GSK, it is unlikely this study can be taken seriously, and based on it the decision to do or not this vaccine, given that this decision may prove fatal.<br><br> I quote this article for two reasons. First, because unlike most others, it refers to scientific research. And secondly, because writers and readers of the above-mentioned community are mostly scientists, doctors, and other people who consider themselves to be scientific and intellectual elite. And none of the ten thousand highly educated and intelligent readers and commentators paid no attention to any of the above facts.
