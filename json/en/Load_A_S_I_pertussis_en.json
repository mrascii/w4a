(Exotoxin is a toxin that a living bacterium secretes, endotoxin is a toxin that is released from the bacterium after its decay). This endotoxin is very toxic and its presence in the vaccine was carefully concealed by the manufacturers.<br> - In the article of 1953 it was stated that practically every vaccinated child had systemic intoxication, and the CNS lesion often remained permanent.<br><br> The first acellular vaccine appeared already in 1937. It was widely used in the 1940s, after which it was discontinued because the company did not want to invest in clinical trials. In the 1960s and 1970s, other acellular vaccines were widely used, which were also withdrawn from production because of their higher cost.<br><br> After the two babies died from vaccination in Japan, the Japanese developed a cell-free vaccine that has been used since 1981.<br><br> Sweden banned the whole-cell vaccine in the 1970s. Despite the lack of vaccination, no child died of pertussis in the next 15 years.<br><br> After four children in Tennessee died in 1979 after being vaccinated from one series, the CDC found that the vaccine was associated with sudden infant death syndrome. While the director of the vaccine department of the FDA was on vacation, the FDA withdrew the entire series. But when the director returned, he ordered to return the whole series for use. He also apologized to the pharmaceutical companies for this act, and promised them not to do so any more. After the incident, the manufacturers do not send the whole series of vaccines to the same place, but distribute each series across the country.<br><br> The article also about how this vaccine has passed a law on compensation to victims of vaccinations, as the Department of Health does everything possible to not compensate the injured, as it turns out that almost all experts on vaccines have a conflict of interest, how experts are selected for committees that are investigating whether the vaccine is associated with such or other side effects, and much more. > - Only in 2001 , 60 years after a safer cell-free vaccine was created, and 20 years after Japan did this, the US switched to a cell-free vaccine. But the whole-cell vaccine is still licensed in the US, as pharmaceutical companies sell it to WHO, which distributes it to other countries whose residents still do not know how dangerous it is. "

A key bacterium settles in the airways, one of the toxins that it secretes is ACT (Adenylate Cyclase Toxin), which deceives the immune system, and does not let it know that whooping cough is a pathogen. But after two weeks, the immune system realizes that its nadurili, and still begins to fight with pertussis. The next time the immune system meets ACT again, it will not be deceived, and immediately it will be suppressed, as a result of which the person will not become infected again. But since ACT is absent in the vaccine, the immune system of the vaccinated person does not know how to react to it, and the vaccinated person becomes infected with whooping cough. And because of the effect of original antigenic sin, she will never learn how to respond effectively to it. Moreover, the more doses a person receives, the more the original antigenic sin acts. This is because the immune system with each dose produces more and more specific B cells. These cells compete with naive B-cells that could adapt and react more efficiently to a slightly altered pathogen. That is, since the vaccine pathogen and the natural pathogen differ from each other, the immune response to real whooping cough in an uncharged person who has recovered will be much more effective than the immune response in the vaccinated.

"digest": "Conclusions:<br><br> Pertussis is dangerous only for infants, but since vaccination does not work for infants, adults and children are vaccinated against whooping cough with one goal - to create a collective immunity that will protect infants from this disease. First, instead of having pertussis once, and forgetting about it for the rest of your life, grafted children and adults can be sick with whooping cough many times. Moreover, since the illness is often asymptomatic, they become \"quiet\" reservoir of infection , spreading it to their families and to infants, and the more vaccine doses they received, the more they are exposed to the infection.Rather than alienating a brother who has fallen ill with a pertussis from a baby, it is difficult to diagnose a brother because of an atypical course of the disease, definition of the disease, and because of the reluctance of doctors to diagnose whooping cough in vaccinated.In order to really protect infants from pertussis, and to create population immunity, you must first stop vaccinating.<br> - The effectiveness of DTaP is negative, because of the phenomenon antigenic sin, and because of the shift of immunity from cellular to humoral.<br> - DTP (DTP) is the most reactive of existing vaccines.<br><br> DTaP contains aluminum, and DTP is also ethyl mercury.<br> - Risk die from vaccination (even DTaP, much safer) is many times higher than the risk of dying from whooping cough.<br> - In recent years, the incidence of pertussis has been increasing steadily. This is not because anti-vaccines have appeared, but on the contrary, because they vaccinate more. We vaccinate pregnant women, vaccinate parents, grandparents, uncles and aunts, and introduce new boosters for children into the vaccination schedule. The more doses the vaccine makes, the further immunity shifts toward Th2, and the more the organism is susceptible to the disease.<br> - When treated with vitamin C, whooping cough takes several days.
