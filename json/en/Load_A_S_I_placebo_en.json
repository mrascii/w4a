"digest": "Pharmaceutical companies want to, of course, reduce the likelihood of unsuccessful clinical trials, but does they have such a legitimate opportunity? It turns out that it's very simple, instead of using a placebo instead of a placebo, toxic, which leads to the same side effects as the vaccine being tested.One of the most toxic components of vaccination is aluminum (this is proven in another part), which is used as an adjuvant in most vaccines. If you use aluminum, or for example aluminum with ethyl mercury, or just another vaccine, you can increase the number of side effects in the control group, and then it will be comparable to the number of side effects in the group that received the new vaccine. From here we conclude that the new vaccine there are no side effects, and it is completely safe.From these data, the FDA and CDC also conclude that the vaccine is safe, and after them all other countries.<br> Is it legal? Absolutely."
